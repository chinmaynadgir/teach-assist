# Introduction:
With educational institutes closed due to the COVID-19
pandemic, the government has been encouraging online
education to achieve academic continuity. Most high-end private
and public institutions have made the switch smoothly using
online platforms such as Zoom, Google classrooms, Microsoft
teams, etc., while many still find it a herculean task.Whatever the
Virtual situation might be one thing is for sure now Teachers and
Faculty have the task of not only having to teach in such an alien
environment but also have to be empathetic to the students,
their technical problems all while still maintaining proper class
records and still being answerable to the management regarding
the data. And to just that we are here with the aim to develop an
end-to-end RPA solution for managing the student attendance
and participation in the online classes,Assignment and Project tracking technology and leave
the teachers to what they are best at .. to teach .

# Problem Statement:
The lecturer when they start the class they have to
create a class and intimate the students and send links , the students start joining and then the
lecturer also has to take attendance. Some let the students unmute and answer , some ask them
to text and some have the students fill a form for attendance , whatever be the method of
attendance , whatever be the app the teacher and the student ends up losing a significant
amount of time in the process and with personal experience this happens to be as much as 15
mins out of a 60 minute class and we often notice students being nudged to stay active in the
class only during the time of attendance. And then comes the problem of assignment tracking ,
having to tell the students about the assignment and keep reminding them about the
assignment and then having to receive the assignments and then tracking who has submitted .
Our approach on Problem Solution:
We are planning to create bots using Uipath Studio, which
will send the link of every online class to the students who are registered for the course through
mail. Also a reminder will be sent to them before every class. We can also use the bot to lock
the meeting after a few minutes so that there will be no unauthorized entries or late entries to
the class. We will use the bot to send a message in the private chat to the participants asking
for their attendance at random time so that they should be attending the class throughout the
entire period of that class. Also once a message has been sent to the student, the bot will wait
for only a few minutes for a reply from the student. If there is no reply from the student within
that time, then the bot will mark the student as absent. At the end of the day, absentee students
will receive an email requesting the reason for their absence. If the student is absent for more
than a few classes, then an email informing the same will be sent to their parents. We also aim
to use this bot to manage the assignments given to the students in the same way by informing
about , reminding , receiving and then categorically storing the assignments and then
informing the students who haven't submitted and take suitable action about the same.
# Beneficiaries:
‚óè Teaching and non-teaching Staff of an educational institute.<br>
‚óè Students enrolled in their programs.<br>
UiPath‚Ñ¢ products in use :<br>
‚óè UiPath‚Ñ¢ Studio: We are using the UiPath Studio to develop the workflow for our
solution.<br>
‚óè UiPath‚Ñ¢ Orchestrator: Though the bot being created would be an attended Robot
, the educational institute may choose to have a centralized approach and thus
choose to keep Orchestrator in use by the management and thus support having
new subject or job specific bots being made by the faculty themselves.<br>
‚óè UiPath‚Ñ¢ Apps: UiPath Apps will be used to create an user-friendly interface to
run the automated workflows.<br>
‚óè UiPath‚Ñ¢ Software Bots : The actual bot responsible for assisting the teacher.<br>
Unique Selling Points:
<br>
‚óè One stop solution combining daily class statistics and assignment tracking.
<br>
‚óè We aim to provide a unique solution, which will improve the quality of online
education.
<br>
‚óè By making use of this automation, the complete duration of the meeting will be
utilized for the teaching purposes.

# Conclusion :
Online education opens up a lot of possibilities for students and teachers alike. Yet, it may lead
to students neglecting the curriculum and teachers not being able to concentrate on the class .
All our AI Bots with regard to online education should strive to be of help to the faculty by going
hand in hand in reducing the grunt work. Good vision, sincere efforts and time will show India
the way ahead
